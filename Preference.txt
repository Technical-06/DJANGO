FLASK Vs DJANGO
									
As I know these both are two of the most popular web framework for Python.
Django and Flask both are free, open-source and designed for building web applications. 
In my PREFERENCE both are good to work on but depends upon the projects ie. small or large,
UNTIL AND UNLESS I was not familiar with DJANGO,I would give my preference to FLASK but as 
I said I havenâ€™t worked on DJANGO before but as of now I used this in my assignment
and I liked to work on it(DJANGO) as there are so much inbuilt features like admin panel,different templates etc.
But for small projects I would choose FLASK as it is easy to learn and code and also very lightweight,there is also route url functions which make the process easier.
Whereas DJANGO i would prefer it for large and complex projects,as there are so much inbuilt features as well as various models also.It has less code of lines.
It divides the project into small-small applications which makes the work easier,fast and manageable.
